/**
 * Rule Types - Type Definitions for Rules System
 *
 * This module contains all TypeScript type definitions for the rules-based
 * transaction categorization system.
 *
 * Key Concepts:
 * - Rules transform transactions using boolean logic (AND/OR operators)
 * - Original Plaid data stored immutably in transaction.plaidData
 * - Current state computed by applying active rules
 * - Rules can be reverted by disabling and recalculating
 *
 * See: src/functions/rules/CLAUDE.md for comprehensive documentation
