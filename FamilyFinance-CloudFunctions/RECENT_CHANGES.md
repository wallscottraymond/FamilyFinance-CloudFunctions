# Recent Changes - October 2025

## Multi-Period Outflow Assignment & Payment Date Tracking

**Date:** October 19, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Completed and Deployed

---

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive multi-period bill payment assignment system that allows transaction splits to be assigned to all three period types (monthly, weekly, bi-weekly) simultaneously, with support for advance payments and consistent payment date tracking.

---

## 1. Multi-Period Assignment Architecture

### Problem Solved
Previously, assigning a bill payment to only one period type caused inconsistency across different views. Users viewing monthly vs weekly vs bi-weekly periods would see different payment statuses for the same bill.

### Solution Implemented
**Bi-Directional References** between transaction splits and outflow periods:

```typescript
// Transaction Split (stores period IDs)
TransactionSplit {
  outflowId: string;                    // Parent outflow
  outflowPeriodId: string;              // Primary period (monthly preferred)
  outflowMonthlyPeriodId: string;       // Monthly period ID
  outflowWeeklyPeriodId: string;        // Weekly period ID
  outflowBiWeeklyPeriodId: string;      // Bi-weekly period ID
  paymentType: PaymentType;             // Payment classification
  paymentDate: Timestamp;               // CRITICAL: matches transaction.date
}

// Outflow Period (stores split references)
OutflowPeriod {
  transactionSplits: TransactionSplitReference[];  // All payments assigned to this period
}
```

### Benefits
- ✅ Consistent payment status across all period views
- ✅ Single API call updates all three period types atomically
- ✅ Supports advance payments across multiple periods
- ✅ Historical payment tracking with `paymentDate` field

---

## 2. New API Functions

### 2.1 `assignSplitToAllOutflowPeriods`

**Location:** `src/functions/outflows/api/assignSplitToAllOutflowPeriods.ts`
**Purpose:** Assign a transaction split to all three outflow period types

**Key Features:**
- Two matching modes:
  1. **Auto-detect:** Uses transaction date to find containing periods
  2. **Target period:** Uses `targetPeriodId` for advance payments
- Updates transaction split with all period references
- Adds `TransactionSplitReference` to all three outflow periods
- Recalculates status for all updated periods
- Atomic batch operations ensure data consistency

**Request Parameters:**
```typescript
{
  transactionId: string;              // Transaction containing split
  splitId: string;                    // Specific split to assign
  outflowId: string;                  // Parent outflow ID
  paymentType?: PaymentType;          // regular | catch_up | advance | extra_principal
  clearBudgetAssignment?: boolean;    // Remove budget assignment
  targetPeriodId?: string;            // For advance payments
}
```

**Response:**
```typescript
{
  success: boolean;
  split?: TransactionSplit;           // Updated split
  monthlyPeriod?: OutflowPeriod;      // Monthly period
  weeklyPeriod?: OutflowPeriod;       // Weekly period
  biWeeklyPeriod?: OutflowPeriod;     // Bi-weekly period
  periodsUpdated: number;             // Count of periods updated (0-3)
  message?: string;
}
```

**Deployed:** ✅ October 19, 2025

---

### 2.2 `unassignSplitFromAllOutflowPeriods`

**Location:** `src/functions/outflows/api/unassignSplitFromAllOutflowPeriods.ts`
**Purpose:** Remove split assignment from all three outflow period types

**Key Features:**
- Removes split from all three period types
- Clears all outflow references from transaction split
- Optionally restores budget assignment
- Recalculates period statuses after removal
- Atomic batch operations

**Request Parameters:**
```typescript
{
  transactionId: string;
  splitId: string;
  restoreBudgetAssignment?: boolean;  // Restore original budget
}
```

**Deployed:** ✅ Previously deployed

---

## 3. New Utility Functions

### 3.1 `findMatchingOutflowPeriods`

**Location:** `src/functions/outflows/utils/findMatchingOutflowPeriods.ts`
**Purpose:** Find all three period types based on transaction date

**How it Works:**
1. Queries `outflow_periods` where date falls within period range
2. Separates results by `periodType` (MONTHLY, WEEKLY, BI_MONTHLY)
3. Returns all three period IDs

**When to Use:**
- Regular payments (use transaction date)
- Auto-matching historical transactions
- Current period lookups

**Example:**
```typescript
const result = await findMatchingOutflowPeriods(
  db,
  "outflow_internet_123",
  Timestamp.fromDate(new Date("2025-10-15"))
);

// Result:
{
  monthlyPeriodId: "outflow_internet_123_2025-M10",
  weeklyPeriodId: "outflow_internet_123_2025-W42",
  biWeeklyPeriodId: "outflow_internet_123_2025-BM20",
  foundCount: 3
}
```

---

### 3.2 `findMatchingOutflowPeriodsBySourcePeriod`

**Location:** `src/functions/outflows/utils/findMatchingOutflowPeriods.ts`
**Purpose:** Find all three period types based on target source period

**How it Works:**
1. Fetches source period to get date range
2. Queries `outflow_periods` where periods overlap with source period
3. Prefers exact matches (same `periodId`)
4. Returns all three period IDs

**When to Use:**
- Advance payments across multiple periods
- User manually specifies target period
- Quarterly or multi-month payments

**Use Case - Paying 3 Months Rent:**
```typescript
// User pays $3,000 for Oct, Nov, Dec rent on Sept 1
// Create 3 splits from the transaction

// October rent ($1,000)
await assignSplitToAllOutflowPeriods({
  transactionId: "txn_123",
  splitId: "split_1",
  outflowId: "rent_outflow",
  paymentType: "advance",
  targetPeriodId: "2025-M10"  // October monthly period
});

// November rent ($1,000)
await assignSplitToAllOutflowPeriods({
  transactionId: "txn_123",
  splitId: "split_2",
  outflowId: "rent_outflow",
  paymentType: "advance",
  targetPeriodId: "2025-M11"  // November monthly period
});

// December rent ($1,000)
await assignSplitToAllOutflowPeriods({
  transactionId: "txn_123",
  splitId: "split_3",
  outflowId: "rent_outflow",
  paymentType: "advance",
  targetPeriodId: "2025-M12"  // December monthly period
});

// Result: All three months show as paid in advance across all views
```

---

## 4. Payment Date Tracking

### Problem Solved
Transaction splits lacked explicit payment date tracking. The date existed on the parent transaction but not on individual splits, making historical analysis difficult.

### Solution Implemented
Added `paymentDate?: Timestamp` field to `TransactionSplit` interface:

```typescript
interface TransactionSplit {
  // ... existing fields ...
  paymentDate?: Timestamp;  // Date when payment was made (matches transaction.date)
}
```

### Implementation Points
Updated ALL split creation locations to set `paymentDate`:

1. **`formatTransactions.ts`** (Line 356)
   - Plaid transaction import
   - Sets `paymentDate: transactionDate` on default split

2. **`migrateTransactionsToSplits.ts`** (Line 153)
   - Migration of existing transactions
   - Sets `paymentDate: transactionData.date`

3. **`assignSplitToAllOutflowPeriods.ts`** (Line 174)
   - Manual outflow assignment
   - Sets `paymentDate: transaction.date`

4. **`autoMatchTransactionToOutflowPeriods.ts`** (Line 369)
   - Auto-matching historical transactions
   - Sets `paymentDate: transactionData.date`

### Benefits
- ✅ Consistent payment date across all splits
- ✅ Historical payment analysis enabled
- ✅ Payment timing calculations accurate
- ✅ Audit trail for when payments were made

---

## 5. Payment Type Classification

### Payment Types

```typescript
enum PaymentType {
  REGULAR = 'regular',              // Normal on-time payment
  CATCH_UP = 'catch_up',            // Payment for past-due bill
  ADVANCE = 'advance',              // Payment made > 7 days before due
  EXTRA_PRINCIPAL = 'extra_principal' // Payment > bill amount
}
```

### Auto-Detection Logic
Used in auto-matching historical transactions:

```typescript
// Extra principal: Amount exceeds bill by > 10%
if (amount > billAmount * 1.1) return 'extra_principal';

// Catch-up: Payment before due date, but due date has passed
if (txnDate < dueDate && dueDate < now) return 'catch_up';

// Advance: Payment > 7 days before due date
if (daysBeforeDue > 7) return 'advance';

// Default: Regular payment
return 'regular';
```

---

## 6. Status Recalculation

### Outflow Period Statuses

```typescript
type OutflowPeriodStatus =
  | 'not_due'    // Not a due period (no payment expected)
  | 'pending'    // Due period with no payments
  | 'partial'    // Due period with some payment (< amount due)
  | 'paid'       // Due period with full payment (≥ amount due)
  | 'overdue';   // Past due date with insufficient payment
```

### Status Calculation Logic
**Location:** `src/functions/outflows/utils/calculateOutflowPeriodStatus.ts`

```typescript
function calculateOutflowPeriodStatus(
  isDuePeriod: boolean,
  dueDate: Timestamp | undefined,
  expectedDueDate: Timestamp | undefined,
  amountDue: number,
  transactionSplits: TransactionSplitReference[]
): OutflowPeriodStatus
```

**Recalculated When:**
- Split assigned to period
- Split unassigned from period
- Period created (initial status)
- Manual status refresh

---

## 7. UI Changes

### Bill Tile Layout Update

**File:** `FamilyFinanceMobile/src/screens/tabs/OutflowsScreenSimplified.tsx`

**Changed:** Two-row layout → Single-row layout

**Old Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Internet Bill               │
│ Due on Oct 31    $89.99     │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**New Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Internet Bill  │  Paid  │  $89.99  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Status Display Logic:**
```typescript
const getStatusText = () => {
  if (outflowPeriod.status === 'paid') return 'Paid';

  if (daysPastDue > 4) return 'Past Due';

  return `Due on ${month} ${day}`;
};
```

**Status Colors:**
- **Paid:** Green (#4CAF50)
- **Past Due:** Red (#F44336)
- **Due Soon:** Orange (#FF9800)
- **Not Due:** Gray (#9E9E9E)

---

## 13. Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Maximum 3 periods per assignment** - By design (monthly, weekly, bi-weekly)
2. **No partial period matching** - Periods must fully contain transaction date
3. **No automatic split creation** - User must manually create splits for advance payments
4. **Status calculation is synchronous** - May add latency for large period sets

### Edge Cases Handled
- ✅ Fewer than 3 periods found (logs warning, continues)
- ✅ Split already assigned to different outflow (throws error)
- ✅ Transaction date outside all period ranges (throws error)
- ✅ Source period not found (throws descriptive error)

---

## 14. Migration Notes

### Database Changes
- **TransactionSplit interface** - Added optional `paymentDate` field
- **No breaking changes** - All new fields are optional
- **Backward compatible** - Existing splits work without paymentDate

### Deployment Steps
1. Update TypeScript types (TransactionSplit interface)
2. Build Cloud Functions (`npm run build`)
3. Deploy updated functions (`firebase deploy --only functions:assignSplitToAllOutflowPeriods`)
4. Update mobile app to call new API
5. Test with sample transactions

### Rollback Plan
If issues occur:
1. Revert Cloud Functions to previous deployment
2. Existing assignments remain functional
3. New assignments use previous single-period logic
4. No data corruption (all changes atomic)
