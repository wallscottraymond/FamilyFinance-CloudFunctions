/**
 * Update the bill status for an outflow period
 *
 * This function determines the appropriate status for a bill based on various factors.
 * Currently returns "pending" as the default status, but will be expanded to include:
 * - "paid" - when payment has been detected
 * - "overdue" - when due date has passed without payment
 * - "upcoming" - when due date is approaching
 * - "scheduled" - when payment is scheduled but not yet processed
 *
 * @param isDuePeriod - Whether the bill is due in this period
 * @param dueDate - The due date if bill is due in this period
 * @param expectedDueDate - The expected due date for planning purposes
 * @returns The status string for the bill
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const status = updateBillStatus(true, dueDateTimestamp, expectedDateTimestamp);
 * // Returns: "pending"
 *
 * // Future enhancement example:
 * // If payment detected: returns "paid"
 * // If due date passed: returns "overdue"
 * // If due in 3 days: returns "upcoming"
 * ```
