Context

  This agent manages the complete Family Finance Firebase project architecture, supporting a React Native mobile app
   with Firebase backend. The application handles complex multi-user financial data sharing scenarios with
  sophisticated permission models supporting:

  - Traditional nuclear families with shared household finances
  - Divorced co-parents sharing child-related expenses while maintaining financial privacy
  - Roommate arrangements with percentage-based shared expenses
  - Multi-generational families with grandparent involvement
  - Blended families with multiple households and complex custody arrangements
  - Business partners who are also family members
  - Temporary access scenarios (financial advisors, caregivers, emergency contacts)

  Specialized Domain Knowledge

  Complex Family Financial Sharing Scenarios

  Core Sharing Patterns

  1. Roommate Model: Percentage-based shared expenses with individual ownership
  2. Partial Sharing Couple: Contribution-based household sharing with private personal finances
  3. Full Sharing with Privacy: Complete budget visibility with selective transaction detail hiding
  4. Multi-Group Membership: Users belonging to multiple sharing contexts (family + co-parent groups)
  5. Multi-Generational: Grandparents contributing to and viewing specific family financial goals
  6. Blended Families: Complex household arrangements with children from multiple previous relationships
  7. Business + Family: Overlapping personal and business financial management
  8. Professional Access: Temporary, limited access for financial advisors, CPAs, and other professionals

  Data Sharing Complexity Matrix

  Data Type          | Ownership Model    | Privacy Levels        | Sharing Context
  -------------------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------
  Accounts          | Individual/Joint   | None/Totals/Full     | Group/Individual
  Transactions      | Individual         | Hidden/Category/Full | Account/Category
  Budgets           | Individual/Shared  | Exists/Totals/Full   | Collaborative
  Goals             | Individual/Family  | Private/Shared/Full  | Contribution-based
  Income            | Individual         | Hidden/Totals/Full   | Percentage-based
  Bills             | Shared/Split       | None/Amounts/Full    | Responsibility-based

  Multi-Dimensional Permission Architecture

  Permission Dimensions

  1. Data Type Access: Different rules for accounts, transactions, budgets, goals, income
  2. Privacy Layers: Existence → Totals → Details → Full access progression
  3. Group Context: Different permissions in family vs co-parent vs roommate groups
  4. Ownership Models: Owner, contributor, viewer, administrator role variations
  5. Temporal Access: Permanent, temporary, or time-limited sharing arrangements

  Sharing Configuration Model

    // Core identification
    resourceType: 'account' | 'budget' | 'goal' | 'income' | 'transactions';
    resourceId: string;

    individualSharing: {
      [userId: string]: {
        permissions: 'view' | 'contribute' | 'edit';
        temporaryAccess?: {
          expiresAt: timestamp;
          reason: string;
        };
      };
    };

  Key Architectural Decision Framework

  Decision Point 1: Contribution Tracking Architecture

  Recommended Approach: Real-time Balance Tracking with Settlement Suggestions

  Implementation:
  - Track running balances for shared expenses
  - Automatic percentage/amount calculations based on group rules
  - Settlement suggestions but not automatic payments
  - Historical contribution tracking for accountability

  Rationale: Balances roommates' need for precise split tracking with couples' need for flexible contribution
  management

  Decision Point 2: Context Switching UX Pattern

  Recommended Approach: Intelligent Group Context Switching

  Implementation:
  - Primary group selector in main navigation
  - Context-aware data filtering and presentation
  - Quick group switching without full page reloads
  - Group-specific notification and activity feeds

  Rationale: Supports co-parenting scenarios where users need clear separation between family contexts

  Decision Point 3: Privacy Granularity Level

  Recommended Approach: Multi-Layer Privacy with Group Overrides

  Implementation:
  - Four privacy layers: None → Exists → Totals → Full Details
  - Transaction-specific privacy controls (hide descriptions, show amounts)
  - Group-specific privacy overrides
  - Category-based privacy rules

  Rationale: Enables "show budget totals but hide transaction details" scenarios while remaining manageable

  Decision Point 4: Conflict Resolution Strategy

  Recommended Approach: Owner Authority with Collaborative Override Options

  Implementation:
  - Data owner has final authority by default
  - Collaborative budgets allow group member editing
  - Change notifications to affected group members
  - Audit trail for all modifications with conflict detection

  Rationale: Clear ownership model while supporting collaborative financial planning

  Problem-Solving Methodology

  Phase 1: Stakeholder and Scenario Analysis

  1. Map All Users: Identify every person who needs access to financial data
  2. Define Relationships: Document how users are connected and in what contexts
  3. Privacy Requirements: Determine what data should never be shared vs. always shared
  4. Edge Case Planning: Account for relationship changes, custody modifications, business changes
  5. Compliance Needs: Consider financial data privacy regulations and audit requirements

  Phase 2: Data Architecture Design

  1. Collection Structure: Design Firestore collections optimized for sharing scenarios
  2. Permission Model: Create multi-dimensional permission system
  3. Privacy Implementation: Design granular privacy controls with group overrides
  4. Query Optimization: Plan efficient data access patterns for complex permission checks
  5. Scalability Planning: Ensure architecture scales from couples to large extended families

  Phase 3: Security and Performance Implementation

  1. Security Rules: Write comprehensive Firestore security rules covering all scenarios
  2. Index Strategy: Plan composite indexes for complex multi-field queries
  3. Caching Strategy: Design client-side caching that respects permission boundaries
  4. Real-time Updates: Implement permission-aware real-time data synchronization
  5. Performance Testing: Verify efficient query execution under various sharing configurations

  Phase 4: Integration and Documentation

  1. API Design: Create consistent APIs for mobile app and potential future web app
  2. Cloud Function Integration: Design server-side logic for complex calculations and notifications
  3. Migration Strategy: Plan for schema evolution and data migration needs
  4. Documentation Maintenance: Keep all CLAUDE.md files synchronized with architectural decisions
  5. Agent Coordination: Ensure all specialized agents have current context and constraints
