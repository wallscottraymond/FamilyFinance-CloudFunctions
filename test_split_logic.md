# Transaction Split Logic Test Scenarios

## Updated Implementation Overview

The transaction split logic has been enhanced to properly handle amount redistribution:

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Updated TransactionSplit Interface** (`/Users/scottwall/Desktop/Projects/FamilyFinance/FamilyFinanceMobile/src/types/transactions.ts`):
   - Added `isDefault?: boolean` field
   - Added `budgetName?: string` and `categoryId?: string` for better split management

2. **Enhanced removeSplit Method** (`/Users/scottwall/Desktop/Projects/FamilyFinance/FamilyFinanceMobile/src/services/transactionService.ts`):
   - When a split is deleted, its amount is redistributed back to the default split
   - If no default split exists, creates one with the redistributed amount
   - Prevents deletion of the default split itself
   - Updates totals and unallocated amounts correctly

3. **Enhanced updateSplit Method** (`/Users/scottwall/Desktop/Projects/FamilyFinance/FamilyFinanceMobile/src/services/transactionService.ts`):
   - When a split amount is reduced, the difference goes to the default split
   - When a split amount is increased, takes from the default split if available
   - Creates new default split if needed for reductions
   - Validates availability before allowing increases

4. **Added Default Split Helper** (`/Users/scottwall/Desktop/Projects/FamilyFinance/FamilyFinanceMobile/src/services/transactionService.ts`):
   - `ensureDefaultSplit()` method to maintain default split integrity
   - Creates default splits for unallocated amounts when needed

5. **Enhanced UI Display** (`/Users/scottwall/Desktop/Projects/FamilyFinance/FamilyFinanceMobile/src/screens/TransactionDetailScreen.tsx`):
   - Default splits are visually distinguished with blue border and background
   - Default splits show "Auto" badge and explanatory text
   - Default splits cannot be edited or deleted (buttons hidden)
   - Non-default splits are shown first, default splits shown last

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Delete a Split
- **Initial**: Transaction $100, Split A $30, Split B $70 (default)
- **Action**: Delete Split A ($30)
- **Expected**: Split B becomes $100 (default), total allocated = $100, unallocated = $0

### Scenario 2: Reduce Split Amount
- **Initial**: Transaction $100, Split A $40, Split B $60 (default)
- **Action**: Edit Split A from $40 to $25
- **Expected**: Split A $25, Split B $75 (default), total allocated = $100, unallocated = $0

### Scenario 3: Increase Split Amount
- **Initial**: Transaction $100, Split A $30, Split B $70 (default)
- **Action**: Edit Split A from $30 to $50
- **Expected**: Split A $50, Split B $50 (default), total allocated = $100, unallocated = $0

### Scenario 4: Create New Split
- **Initial**: Transaction $100, no splits
- **Action**: Add Split A $30
- **Expected**: Split A $30, Default Split $70, total allocated = $100, unallocated = $0

### Scenario 5: Multiple Split Management
- **Initial**: Transaction $100, Split A $25, Split B $35, Default $40
- **Action**: Delete Split B ($35)
- **Expected**: Split A $25, Default $75, total allocated = $100, unallocated = $0

## Key Features

1. **Amount Conservation**: Total allocated amount always equals transaction amount
2. **Default Split Persistence**: Always maintains a default split when needed
3. **Validation**: Prevents invalid operations like over-allocation
4. **UI Clarity**: Clear visual distinction between custom and default splits
5. **User Experience**: Intuitive behavior where amounts don't disappear

## Error Handling

- Cannot delete the default split
- Cannot increase split beyond available default split amount
- Cannot exceed transaction total amount
- Clear error messages for validation failures
- Proper logging for debugging

The implementation now ensures that when splits are deleted or reduced, the amounts are properly redistributed to maintain the full transaction amount allocation.
